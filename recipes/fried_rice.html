        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe that I made, based loosely off my grandma's recipe.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cold (cooked) rice left overnight in a fridge</li>
            <li>2 eggs (depending on how much rice)</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Diced meat of choice (chicken, beef, pork)</li>
            <li>Vegetable of choice (onions, carrots)</li>
            <li>Spring onion</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mince garlic: </strong>Take garlic and dice or grind them into smaller pieces, then set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir fry meat: </strong>After the pan gets hot, add a suitable amount of olive oil and then the diced garlic. When the garlic starts emanating a smell and is starting to turn brown, add the meat of choice into a frying pan and stir fry together until fully cooked through.</li>
            <li><strong>Add rice: </strong>Add in rice and stirfry.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir fry veggies: </strong>Stir fry your vegetable of choice in until they shrink.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare eggs: </strong>Crack eggs into a bowl and set aside. It is up to the cook whether they want to stir the eggs or crack and leave them. Add in the eggs into the rice when appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Taste and season: </strong>Give the rice a taste, and season with soy sauce and pepper or any other condiments like sesame oil and oyster sauce if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Dish it up and serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
